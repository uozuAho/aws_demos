# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project

This was created by installing [cdklocal](https://github.com/localstack/aws-cdk-local)
then running `cdklocal init sample-app --language=javascript`.

## Quick start


## Blurb that came with this app

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with
an instance of a stack (`LocalstackSampleStack`) which contains an Amazon SQS
queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build
step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

* `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
